- Preset count and current preset name display
- Version information accessible in settings menu

### üì± Device Compatibility

- **Minimum Android Version**: Android 5.0 (Lollipop)
- **Target Devices**: Android TV boxes and TVs with Android TV OS
- **GPU Requirement**: OpenGL ES 2.0 capable GPU
- **Performance**: Now better optimized for lower-end devices with automatic quality adjustments

### üìã Permissions Required

- `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` - Required for audio visualization processing

### üêõ Known Issues

- Some complex presets may still cause performance issues, but are now automatically managed
- Occasional black screen when switching between certain presets
- Audio capture may not work on all devices depending on manufacturer restrictions
- Navigation in the settings menu may require multiple button presses on some remote controls

### üéÆ Usage Tips

- **Classic Experience**: Keep transitions at 7s and preset duration around 30s
- **Dynamic Show**: Try shorter preset durations (10-15s) with shorter transitions (2-3s)
- **Manual Control**: Disable auto-change and use the remote for immediate transitions
- **Performance Mode**: Lower transition duration and resolution on less powerful devices

### üîú Upcoming Features

- Preset search and filtering
- Custom preset categories
- Background audio playback
- Beat detection sensitivity adjustment
- Preset rating system

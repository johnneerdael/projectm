## Enhanced Visualization & Resolution Fixes

We're excited to announce version 1.3 of projectM for Android TV, focusing on fixing viewport scaling issues and resolution-related artifacts. This update ensures visualizations properly stretch to fill the entire screen at all resolutions while eliminating visual artifacts during resolution changes.

## ÔøΩ Enhanced Visualization Controls

We're excited to announce version 1.2 of projectM for Android TV, featuring improved performance adaptation, an enhanced loading experience, and better control navigation. This update provides a more responsive and stable visualization experience, especially on lower-end devices.

### ‚ú® New Features & Fixes in 1.4

- **FIXED: Full-Screen Viewport Scaling** - Completely resolved the issue where lower resolutions (720p, 480p) were not stretching to fill the entire screen
- **Enhanced OpenGL Viewport Management** - Added aggressive viewport control that prevents ProjectM from overriding display scaling
- **Native Viewport Persistence** - Implemented viewport restoration at both Java and native C++ levels
- **Resolution-Independent Display** - All render resolutions now properly scale to full TV screen regardless of internal rendering size
- **Improved Viewport Diagnostics** - Added comprehensive logging to verify viewport settings are maintained correctly

### üéµ Existing Features

- **Complete Cream of the Crop Preset Collection** - All 9,795 handpicked presets included
- **System Audio Visualization** - Visualizes any audio playing on your Android TV
- **Android TV Remote Control**
  - Left/Right buttons to change presets (now with instant transitions)
  - Center/Menu button to toggle settings overlay
  - Back button to exit or hide overlay
- **Auto Preset Switching** - Configurable timing with new extended range
- **Performance Monitoring** - Adaptive rendering with improved transition handling
- **Full Screen Immersive Mode** - Complete Android TV visual experience

### üîß Technical Details

- Built on projectM-4 native visualization library
- OpenGL ES 2.0 hardware-accelerated rendering
- FPS monitoring with performance mode switching
- Preset count and current preset name display
- Version information accessible in settings menu

### üì± Device Compatibility

- **Minimum Android Version**: Android 5.0 (Lollipop)
- **Target Devices**: Android TV boxes and TVs with Android TV OS
- **GPU Requirement**: OpenGL ES 2.0 capable GPU
- **Performance**: Now better optimized for lower-end devices with automatic quality adjustments

### üìã Permissions Required

- `RECORD_AUDIO` - Required for capturing system audio
- `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` - Required for audio visualization processing

### üêõ Known Issues

- Some complex presets may still cause performance issues, but are now automatically managed
- Occasional black screen when switching between certain presets
- Audio capture may not work on all devices depending on manufacturer restrictions
- Navigation in the settings menu may require multiple button presses on some remote controls

### üéÆ Usage Tips

- **Classic Experience**: Keep transitions at 7s and preset duration around 30s
- **Dynamic Show**: Try shorter preset durations (10-15s) with shorter transitions (2-3s)
- **Manual Control**: Disable auto-change and use the remote for immediate transitions
- **Performance Mode**: Lower transition duration and resolution on less powerful devices

### üîú Upcoming Features

- Preset search and filtering
- Custom preset categories
- Background audio playback
- Beat detection sensitivity adjustment
- Preset rating system

### üöÄ Installation

1. Download the APK file from this release
2. Install on your Android TV using one of these methods:
   - Sideload with adb: `adb install projectm-androidtv-1.2.apk`
   - Transfer via USB and install with a file manager
   - Use a sideloading app like Downloader or Send Files to TV
   
If you're updating from version 1.0 or 1.1, your preferences will be preserved.

# projectM Android TV 1.5 - Complete Viewport Scaling Resolution

## Definitive Viewport Scaling Fix

We're excited to announce version 1.5 of projectM for Android TV, which completely resolves the long-standing viewport scaling issues. This release ensures that all render resolutions (720p, 480p, etc.) properly stretch to fill the entire TV screen, providing a true fullscreen experience regardless of the internal rendering resolution used for performance optimization.c### ✨ New Features & Fixes in 1.3droid TV 1.3 - Resolution Scaling & Viewport Fixes

## Enhanced Visualization & Resolution Fixes

We're excited to announce version 1.3 of projectM for Android TV, focusing on fixing viewport scaling issues and resolution-related artifacts. This update ensures visualizations properly stretch to fill the entire screen at all resolutions while eliminating visual artifacts during resolution changes.

## � Enhanced Visualization Controls

We're excited to announce version 1.2 of projectM for Android TV, featuring improved performance adaptation, an enhanced loading experience, and better control navigation. This update provides a more responsive and stable visualization experience, especially on lower-end devices.

### ✨ New Features & Fixes in 1.5

- **COMPLETELY RESOLVED: Viewport Scaling Issue** - All render resolutions now properly stretch to fill the entire TV screen (720p, 480p no longer appear as partial screen)
- **Advanced Viewport Management System** - Implemented multi-layered viewport control that prevents any library override of display scaling
- **Native-Level Viewport Persistence** - C++ code maintains display dimensions and aggressively restores viewport after every ProjectM operation
- **Real-time Viewport Verification** - Added diagnostic system that detects and corrects viewport changes immediately
- **Performance-Optimized Scaling** - Lower render resolutions for performance while maintaining perfect fullscreen display

### 🎵 Existing Features

- **Complete Cream of the Crop Preset Collection** - All 9,795 handpicked presets included
- **System Audio Visualization** - Visualizes any audio playing on your Android TV
- **Android TV Remote Control**
  - Left/Right buttons to change presets (now with instant transitions)
  - Center/Menu button to toggle settings overlay
  - Back button to exit or hide overlay
- **Auto Preset Switching** - Configurable timing with new extended range
- **Performance Monitoring** - Adaptive rendering with improved transition handling
- **Full Screen Immersive Mode** - Complete Android TV visual experience

### 🔧 Technical Details

- Built on projectM-4 native visualization library
- OpenGL ES 2.0 hardware-accelerated rendering
- FPS monitoring with performance mode switching
- Preset count and current preset name display
- Version information accessible in settings menu

### 📱 Device Compatibility

- **Minimum Android Version**: Android 5.0 (Lollipop)
- **Target Devices**: Android TV boxes and TVs with Android TV OS
- **GPU Requirement**: OpenGL ES 2.0 capable GPU
- **Performance**: Now better optimized for lower-end devices with automatic quality adjustments

### 📋 Permissions Required

- `RECORD_AUDIO` - Required for capturing system audio
- `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` - Required for audio visualization processing

### 🐛 Known Issues

- Some complex presets may still cause performance issues, but are now automatically managed
- Occasional black screen when switching between certain presets
- Audio capture may not work on all devices depending on manufacturer restrictions
- Navigation in the settings menu may require multiple button presses on some remote controls

### 🎮 Usage Tips

- **Classic Experience**: Keep transitions at 7s and preset duration around 30s
- **Dynamic Show**: Try shorter preset durations (10-15s) with shorter transitions (2-3s)
- **Manual Control**: Disable auto-change and use the remote for immediate transitions
- **Performance Mode**: Lower transition duration and resolution on less powerful devices

### 🔜 Upcoming Features

- Preset search and filtering
- Custom preset categories
- Background audio playback
- Beat detection sensitivity adjustment
- Preset rating system
